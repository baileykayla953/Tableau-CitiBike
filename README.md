Citi Bike's target audienceare predominantly males born in the years 1988-1991.

Citi Bike is most successful as a subscriber service. However, there is some profit in the customer rides.

## Top Ten Routes Analysis 
The top 7 routes from both the start and ending routes are interchangably the most popular on both start and end routes.

The top 7 routes are closer in location to each other than the other routes. This could be an indication that Citi Bikes are most used for busier, more populated areas to get to a location relative close quicker.
